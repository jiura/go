Go without the stupid unused variable/import error warnings.

The "errors" are still there, but you can run your code.

Clone the repo, add bin folder to PATH and run "dog" instead of "go", as in:

```
dog run main.go
```

If you already had go installed, you can keep using the official compiler to build. This here is only intended for faster developing and testing.

If I wanted an annoying language that sucks all the joy out of programming in the name of "safety", "good practices" or whatever, I'd use Rust.
